# ImpulseLock: Mindful Spending Assistant

ImpulseLock is a Chrome extension and mobile plugin designed to help users avoid impulsive online purchases by applying psychological friction before completing transactions.

## Features

- **Purchase Interruption**: Detects checkout pages and overlays a modal when users attempt to make a purchase
- **Reflection Timer**: Enforces a 10-second pause before allowing the purchase to continue 
- **Mindful Spending**: Requires users to articulate why they're making this purchase right now
- **Savings Redirection**: Option to save the money instead of completing the purchase
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks impulse purchases stopped and money saved
- **Behavioral Insights**: Analyzes spending patterns and provides personalized tips

## How It Works

1. **Detect Purchase Intent**: The extension identifies when a user is about to complete a purchase
2. **Activate Impulse Vault**: A modal appears, blocking the purchase button 
3. **Enforced Reflection**: Users must wait 10 seconds and explain their purchase motivation
4. **Decision Support**: After reflection, users can proceed with the purchase or save the money
5. **Track Progress**: All decisions are recorded to help users visualize their spending habits

## Technology

This application is built with:
- React with TypeScript
- TailwindCSS for styling
- LocalStorage for data persistence (MVP version)

## Next Steps

Future enhancements planned for ImpulseLock include:
- Chrome Web Store extension packaging
- Mobile app version using React Native
- Cloud synchronization across devices
- Integration with banking APIs for direct savings transfers
- Machine learning to better predict and prevent impulsive spending

## Business Model

ImpulseLock follows a freemium model:
- **Free tier**: Basic impulse control features

- **Enterprise**: B2B offering for banks and financial institutions

## About

ImpulseLock was created based on behavioral economics research showing that introducing even small friction points in the purchasing process can significantly reduce impulsive spending.
